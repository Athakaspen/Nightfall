This was a Fall 2021 Game Jam project, created in one week by myself.

For this project I made a scalable difficulty system using AnimationCurves as inspector parameters, allowing fine-tuned, visual control of the game's difficulty curve in relation to the player's progress.
This let me carefully craft a difficulty curve I was happy with, while also allowing players to choose an easier or more challenging experience.  
  
I also usec C# Interfaces to generalize Damageable and Interactable objects, which would have allowed me to easily add more gameplay features like extra enemies and resources to collect if I'd had more time.
