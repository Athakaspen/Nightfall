This was a Fall 2021 Game Jam project, created in one week by myself.  
  
You can play it here (download for the best experience): https://athakaspen.itch.io/nightfall

The main feature I spent time working on for this project was a scalable difficulty system, allowing me to create multiple difficulty options and freely change their parameters from the Unity inspector.  
I used AnimationCurves to allow fine-tuned, visual control of the game's difficulty curve in relation to the player's progress.  
This let me carefully craft a difficulty curve I was happy with, while also allowing players to choose an easier or more challenging experience.
